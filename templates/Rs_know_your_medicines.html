      <tr>
        <td>Paracetamol (Acetaminophen)</td>
        <td>Nausea (rare), liver toxicity in overdose</td>
        <td>Generally recommended as first-line for pain/fever in pregnancy when needed at the lowest effective dose; regulatory bodies are monitoring emerging studies so use under medical advice. </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Amoxicillin / Penicillins</td>
        <td>Diarrhea, allergic reactions (rash, anaphylaxis in rare cases)</td>
        <td>Widely used and generally considered safe in pregnancy for recommended indications; avoid if allergic to penicillins. </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Ondansetron (Zofran)</td>
        <td>Headache, constipation, dizziness</td>
        <td>Often used for severe pregnancy nausea/vomiting; most studies show low overall risk but some observational studies reported small possible links with cardiac anomalies — discuss risks/benefits with your clinician. </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline)</td>
        <td>Gastrointestinal upset, photosensitivity</td>
        <td>Generally avoided in pregnancy because they can deposit in fetal bones/teeth (may cause discolouration and affect bone growth); alternative antibiotics are preferred. </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Ibuprofen & other NSAIDs</td>
        <td>Stomach upset, increased bleeding tendency, kidney effects with prolonged use</td>
        <td>Use is discouraged especially after ~20 weeks (and in the 3rd trimester) because of risk of reduced amniotic fluid and fetal kidney/heart effects; avoid unless directed by a clinician. </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Metformin</td>
        <td>Nausea, diarrhea, metallic taste (usually mild)</td>
        <td>Used for gestational diabetes/PCOS in some cases; considered by many clinicians when benefits outweigh risks — use only under obstetric care and blood-glucose monitoring. </td>
